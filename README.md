### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - List your current skills and areas of expertise:

    - Python ‚Äì Intermediate: Comfortable with syntax, loops, functions, classes. I can use Python to build back-end logic in Django.
    - JavaScript ‚Äì Beginner to Intermediate: Familiar with DOM, events, fetch, and some async, but still learning. I really enjoy using JS to manipulate a webpage in real-time.
    - Django ‚Äì Intermediate: I have built multiple apps in Django and Flask, I have a decent understanding of models, views, and templates. I am still learning best practices, documentation, and how to write clean code for more complex projects.
    - C ‚Äì Beginner: Completed CS50, familiar with syntax and memory concepts, but haven't used it much beyond coursework. I enjoyed learning about pointers and how much control you get from a language like C. I have a lot to learn about algorithms and refactoring code to be as fast as possible.
    - Websockets - I have experimented with real-time communications between the browser and server. I am eager to explore this more.

    **Projects that I have built**

    - Ecommerce site in Django
    - Stock market trading app (simulation trading) in Flask
    - Steam Clone/game with leaderboard and profile (very far from being a complete Steam clone) in Django
    - Google search clone (no framework)
    - Activity tracking app in Flask
    - Gmail clone in Django (a lot of the code here was provided)
    - Social media app in Django
 
    **Skills to improve**

    - CSS and front-end design/layout
    - Database management
    - Data analytics


2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    I am passionate about backend development, creative problem-solving, and real-time systems. I enjoy exploring unconventional solutions and finding innovative ways to optimize functionality. Rather than just accepting "the standard way," I prefer to test new approaches, even if they do not always work. I believe that understanding what‚Äôs possible is just as valuable as finding the correct solution. From the research that I have done, my interests seem to align with roles such as backend engineer, software engineer, systems architect, and real-time systems developer. In these roles, I can focus on optimizing performance and pushing the boundaries of what can be done with the existing technologies.


    ü§ù Collaborative but Independent-Friendly
    - I enjoy working with others but also value time set aside for individual focus.

    ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced, Hardworking, and Professional
    - I thrive in a workplace where people are dedicated and hardworking but maintain a calm and supportive attitude when mistakes or issues arise. While I understand that work is for work, I appreciate compassionate and understanding colleagues who support one another.

    üìö Growth-Oriented & Supportive
    - I value a knowledge-sharing culture where everyone works towards the same goal and helps each other grow. 
    - I also enjoy healthy competition‚Äîtrue competitors push each other to improve, not win by gatekeeping information.

    üî• High-Pressure, Low-Drama
    - I handle pressure well and believe deadlines help keep me focused and in the flow. However, I prefer working with colleagues who manage stress calmly and professionally rather than creating conflict.

    - I strongly dislike environments where people become aggressive, assign blame, or create unnecessary drama under pressure.

    üåü I imagine the correct work environment for me to be something like:
    ‚úÖ Small to mid-sized teams where I can collaborate but also focus on independent tasks.
    ‚úÖ Tech startups or product-based companies that encourage innovation and do not handcuf their employees with fear of failure.
    ‚úÖ Developer teams with a strong learning culture (e.g., code reviews, mentorship, and open discussions).
    ‚úÖ Remote or hybrid work environments where I can engage with teammates but also have my own focused work time.

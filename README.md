    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.

    Beginning with a end project in mind. The end project that I am planning on creating in the future is a game dev platform. The 'dream goal' is to build the game engine that devs can use to create games easily and sell them on the site. So the site would need end to end website dev, game engine dev, money transaction functionality, etc. I think beginning with a project in mind can help me stay focused and set my priorities accordingly. This particular idea does not have to be the final app, this is just more of a proof of concept for staying motivated towards learning new technologies and progression in line with my interests and 'dream goal' of working for myself. With these skills I could piviot to many differnt ideas but the main end goal is to work for myself. This is similar to Roblox or what Epic does with their engine. I would like to focus on making the 'Roblox' experience more suited to trained game devs and their needs to create a game in the way that they would like. I prefer a model with a steep learning curve for high reward to a all round easier user experience but having limited optimization and custimization. I want to focus on a custom engine that is lightweight but does not sacrifice graphic fedelity and can run smoothly on older hardware. A performance-optimized game engine for low-end PCs & mobile.

    **Goal 1:** Complete and excel in the software developer Bootcamp that I am currently enrolled in with CodeSpace.
